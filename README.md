# Applied Mathematical Modelling

This repository contains mathematical models of scientific and engineering systems.
Each model follows a structured approach:

1. Problem definition
2. Modelling assumptions
3. Mathematical formulation
4. Analytical and numerical analysis
5. Interpretation of results

## Models
- Battery charge–discharge dynamics (ODE-based model)

## Tools
Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter
