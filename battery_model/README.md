# Battery Charge–Discharge Dynamics

This model describes the temporal evolution of a battery's state of charge (SoC)
using a first-order differential equation.

The purpose of this model is to:
- Demonstrate mathematical modelling of an energy storage system
- Explore the relationship between charging power, discharging power, and capacity
- Provide a foundation for stochastic and optimization-based extensions

## Applications
- Renewable energy microgrids
- Energy storage systems
- Load balancing and peak shaving

## Modelling Approach
The system is modelled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs),
with parameters chosen to reflect physically realistic battery behaviour.
