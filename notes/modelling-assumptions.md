# Modelling Principles and Assumptions

## General Modelling Philosophy
All models in this repository aim to balance simplicity and realism.
Models are constructed to capture dominant dynamics while remaining interpretable.

## Battery Model Assumptions
- Battery state is represented by a single variable: state of charge (SoC)
- Charging and discharging efficiencies are constant
- Temperature effects are neglected
- Battery degradation is neglected
- Power inputs are externally prescribed functions of time
